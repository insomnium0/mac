silly little simple cli based mac changer, for now...

just a little starter project for me to get used to github, and how to use vscode.
more updates coming in the future; planning on getting familiar with github through this project, along other future repos.

hopefully by the time that the next set of eyes gaze upon this shitty beginner repo, it would prove to be a testament to how much i've grown since.

anyways, heres how to download this and use it or something

# Download
to download this repo, run
```
git clone https://github.com/insomnium0/mac.git
```
then you just have to cd into the file, like so
```
cd mac
```
you are now ready to use it.

# Usage
to use this tool, the command has to be structured like so
```
python mac.py -i <interface> -m <mac_address>
```
so for example,
```
python mac.py -i wlan0 -m 00:11:22:33:44:55
```
make sure the mac address is 6 bytes long, and youre golden!
